      h2 Punishment rules

      p You are punished when the clock runs out and you have not made a move.
      p You must then move the unfortunate piece as instructed toward its doom.
      p You must perform the first move that you can perform.
      p If you can't perform a move then get a new move.
      p If no moves of the chosen piece can be performed or you don't have the piece then get a new piece.
      p All steps in the move must be moved, up to what is allowed for that piece.
      p A pawn with an attack move must first try to attack in the instructed direction, and if it can't do that take one step forward instead.
      p You may break any of these rules in an agreement with your opponent, or just break them like whatever.

      h2 Tips for more fun

      p Play around with different round times and which pieces can be punished to come up with cool games like:

      ul
        li
          h3 The original idea
          p.
            4 minutes rounds and all pieces but King and Queen are punishable.
            Some time to think your moves over but the games won't go on forever.
        li
          h3 Play dangerously
          p.
            20 seconds rounds, only King and Queen are punishable, and
            the additional rule that if you can't move you don' have to.
            Fast-paced danger for the adrenaline hunters.

      p Don't forget you can change these settings any time while you're playing a game of chess.
